How to run project
Springboot project:
Make a .env file in resources and add this: DB="mongodb+srv://123:123@menu.hmcvdtv.mongodb.net/"
I just ran it by running the class DemoprojectApplication

React project: 
Run npm and install and then run the project by clicking the run script in package.json

python-filter:
Use python 3.6.0, and run pip install flask-cors. The rest should suggest being installed automatically

python-datacollector:
A queue called queue needs to be added in rabbitmq.
